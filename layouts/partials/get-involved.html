					CCC is a great opportunity to present what you have been working on to an engaged audience.  
					<br /><br />
					All talks should be submitted to ApacheCon with a note to specify the CCC track.
					<br /><br />
					A CCC flag is being added to the talk submission form, but if you don't see it yet, add a note in the <code>Audience</code> section to specify CloudStack or CCC so the talk ends up in the CCC track.
					<br /><br />
					<i>Each accepted talk includes one free registration to the conference.</i>
					<br /><br />
					<h4>The <i>Call For Participation (CFP)</i> closes on <b><i><u>February 11th</u></i></b>, so get your topic in today.</h4>
